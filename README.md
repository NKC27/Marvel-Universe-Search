# Marvel-Universe-Search

## Description

Marvel Universe Search is a search engine, which provides a user with a variety of information surrounding character of their choice. Using the marvel font and traditional red and white theme, we want to create a website that would appeal to the super-hero fanbase that want to know a little more about their favourite characters. We have chosen to use [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) as our CSS framework, which will allow us to create a clean, user-friendly database that will speed up our styling process.

## User Story:
